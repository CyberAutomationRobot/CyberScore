# CyberScore

Welcome to CyberScore, a comprehensive security tool available for both Windows and Mac. CyberScore is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of several key security measures on your computer, giving you insights and tools to enhance your system's security posture.

## Features

CyberScore evaluates the following areas of your system:

- **Application Whitelist Effectiveness**: Checks if unauthorized applications are blocked from running.
- **Office Macro Protection**: Tests protections against potentially malicious macros.
- **Anti-virus Efficiency**: Utilizes the eicar test virus to determine if your anti-virus software is effectively detecting and blocking threats.
- **Script Execution Safeguards**: Assesses the restrictions placed on script execution to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.
- **Open File Shares**: Identifies open file shares that might be at risk, especially if they contain sensitive information.
- **Default Credentials on Routers**: Scans for common default usernames and passwords that are often exploited.
- **Web Access Control Settings**: Reviews the settings that control web access to ensure they are secure.

After running these tests, CyberScore provides you with a score reflecting the current security status of your system along with detailed recommendations on how to improve your defenses.

### Secure and Undo Features

- **Secure Button**: With a single click, you can harden your computer's security settings to enhance your Cyber Score. This feature adjusts settings based on the vulnerabilities found.
- **Undo Button**: If the changes lead to operational issues, you can revert to the original settings with the Undo feature.

## Important Notes

- **Eicar Test Virus**: CyberScore uses the eicar test virus to test the response of your anti-virus software. This file is not a real virus but a test file used universally to test anti-virus protection. If your system reacts to this file, it is a good indication that your anti-virus is active and effective. If you see an alert or the file executes, simply close it; it is harmless.
- **False Positives**: Due to the nature of the eicar test virus, some anti-virus programs may detect CyberScore as malware. This detection is a false positive that can be safely ignored.
