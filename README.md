## Features

CyberScore evaluates the following areas of your system:

- **Application Whitelist Effectiveness**: Checks if unauthorized applications are blocked from running.
- **Office Macro Protection**: Tests protections against potentially malicious macros.
- **Anti-virus Efficiency**: Utilizes the eicar test virus to determine if your anti-virus software is effectively detecting and blocking threats.
- **Script Execution Safeguards**: Assesses the restrictions placed on script execution to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.
- **Open File Shares**: Identifies open file shares that might be at risk, especially if they contain sensitive information.
- **Default Credentials on Routers**: Scans for common default usernames and passwords that are often exploited.
- **Web Access Control Settings**: Reviews the settings that control web access to ensure they are secure.

After running these tests, CyberScore provides you with a score reflecting the current security status of your system along with detailed recommendations on how to improve your defenses.

### Secure and Undo Features

- **Secure Button**: With a single click, you can harden your computer's security settings to enhance your Cyber Score. This feature adjusts settings based on the [ACSC's Essential 8](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-explained). Available for Windows Only at this stage.
- **Undo Button**: If the changes lead to operational issues, you can revert to the original settings with the Undo feature.

## Important Notes

- **Eicar Test Virus**: CyberScore uses the eicar test virus to test the response of your anti-virus software. This file is not a real virus but a test file used universally to test anti-virus protection. If your system reacts to this file, it is a good indication that your anti-virus is active and effective. If you see an alert or the file executes, simply close it; it is harmless.
- **False Positives**: Due to the nature of the eicar test virus, some anti-virus programs may detect CyberScore as malware. This detection is a false positive that can be safely ignored.
