## Features

CyberScore evaluates the following areas of your system:

- **Application Whitelist Effectiveness**: Checks if unauthorized applications are blocked from running.
- **Office Macro Protection**: Tests protections against potentially malicious macros.
- **Anti-virus Efficiency**: Utilizes the eicar test virus to determine if your anti-virus software is effectively detecting and blocking threats.
- **Script Execution Safeguards**: Assesses the restrictions placed on script execution to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.
- **Open File Shares**: Identifies open file shares that might be at risk, especially if they contain sensitive information.
- **Default Credentials on Routers**: Scans for common default usernames and passwords that are often exploited.
- **Web Access Control Settings**: Reviews the settings that control web access to ensure they are secure.

After running these tests, CyberScore provides you with a score reflecting the current security status of your system along with detailed recommendations on how to improve your defenses.

## Important Notes

- **CyberScore does NOT contain viruses**: The screenshot below from VirusTotal shows that all commercial anti-virus products deem CyberScore to be safe.

- **Eicar Test Virus**: CyberScore uses the eicar test virus to test the response of your anti-virus software. This file is not a real virus but a test file used universally to test anti-virus protection. If your system reacts to this file, it is a good indication that your anti-virus is active and effective. If you see an alert or the file executes, simply close it; it is harmless.
- **False Positives**: Due to the nature of the eicar test virus, some anti-virus programs may detect CyberScore as malware. This detection is a false positive that can be safely ignored.

- **Eicar Files Opened**: Your anti-virus can make mistakes and sometimes the Eicar test signature files will open. Don't worry if this happens, just close those files and wait for the report to finish in your Web Browser.
- **CyberScore is quarantined or Blocked**: If CyberScore is blocked because your anti-virus detected the Eicar test signatures, just un-quarantine the CyberScore application and execute it. **Do not disable your anti-virus**.
